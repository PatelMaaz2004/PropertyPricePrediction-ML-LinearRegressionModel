# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning model** to predict **house prices** based on various property and location-related features. The objective is to understand how different factors influence housing prices and to build a reliable predictive model using **Multiple Linear Regression**.

The project was completed as a **trainer-assigned task** and demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow including data understanding, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## 📄 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict the **price of a house** using the given independent features such as property size, number of rooms, location indicators, and neighborhood factors.

The original problem statement provided by the trainer is included in the `docs` folder for reference.

## 🔢 Dataset Information

The dataset contains information related to housing properties and surrounding factors.

### 🧠 Independent Variables (X)

* `area_sqft` – Area of the house in square feet
* `bedrooms` – Number of bedrooms
* `bathrooms` – Number of bathrooms
* `age_years` – Age of the house in years
* `distance_city_center_km` – Distance from city center (in km)
* `num_schools_nearby` – Number of nearby schools
* `crime_rate_index` – Crime rate index of the locality

### 🎯 Dependent Variable (Y)

* `price` – Price of the house

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling and analysis
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning model building

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

* **Algorithm Used:** Multiple Linear Regression
* The model learns the linear relationship between multiple independent variables and the target variable (house price).

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

The model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

* **R² Score** – Measures how well the model explains price variation
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Average prediction error
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – Magnitude of prediction errors

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* House price increases with larger area and more rooms
* Distance from city center and higher crime rate negatively impact prices
* Multiple factors together contribute to accurate price prediction

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how **Multiple Linear Regression** can be used to predict house prices based on real-world features. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation in machine learning projects.
